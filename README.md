# Car Management System

This is a comprehensive **Car Management System** developed using Laravel, designed to streamline the management of car dealerships and individual car sales. The system handles car details, sales transactions, installment payments, and provides reporting functionalities to help track sales performance and inventory. 

## Overview

The **Car Management System** is a powerful tool for managing car dealerships, sales, and customer relationships. It provides a central platform where admins can track car listings, sales transactions, and generate detailed reports on sales performance.

The system includes the following features:

- **Car Details Management:** Admins can add, edit, and remove car listings, providing essential details such as model, year, price, and availability.
- **Sales Management:** The system allows for the management of both full and installment-based car sales, keeping track of customer payments and ensuring timely follow-ups on installment payments.
- **Installment Payments:** For customers who purchase vehicles on an installment basis, the system tracks each payment, provides due dates for future payments, and alerts the admin in case of overdue payments.
- **Reporting:** The system generates detailed reports on sales performance, customer data, car inventory, and payment histories. These reports help dealership owners make informed business decisions.
- **User Roles:** Different roles, such as admin and sales staff, are supported to ensure that users only have access to the features relevant to their role in the dealership.

This solution is designed for car dealerships of all sizes, helping them automate processes, maintain a clear record of their transactions, and optimize customer relationships.
